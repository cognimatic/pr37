INTRODUCTION
------------

This adds Javascript to entity and configuration forms to allow the form to be
submitted via a key combination: command-s or control-s. The Javascript triggers
a click on the submit button, so any validation or submit handlers should
function normally.

   module. Visit https://www.drupal.org/node/1897420 for further information.
